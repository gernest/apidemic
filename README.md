# apidemic [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gernest/apidemic.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gernest/apidemic)

Apidemic is a service for generating fake JSON response. You first register the sample JSON response, and apidemic will serve that response with random fake data.

This is experimental, so take it with a grain of salt.

# Motivation
I got bored with hardcoding the sample json api response in tests. If you know golang, you can benefit by using the library, I have included a router that you can use to run disposable servers in your tests.

# Installation

You can download the binaries for your respective operating system  [Download apidemic](https://github.com/gernest/apidemic/releases/latest)

Then put the downloaded binary somewhere in your system path.

Alternatively, if you have golang installed

	go get github.com/gernest/apidemic/cmd/apidemic
	

Now you can start the service like this 

	apidemic start
	
This will run a service at localhost default port is 3000, you can change the port by adding a flag `--port=YOUR_PORT_NUMBER`


# How to use
Lets say you expect a response like this

```json
{
  "name": "anton",
  "age": 29,
  "nothing": null,
  "true": true,
  "false": false,
  "list": [
      "first",
      "second"
    ],
  "list2": [
    {
      "street": "Street 42",
      "city": "Stockholm"
      },
    {
      "street": "Street 42",
      "city": "Stockholm"
      }
    ],
  "address": {
    "street": "Street 42",
    "city": "Stockholm"
  },
  "country": {
    "name": "Sweden"
  }
}
```


If you have already started apidemic server you can register that response by making a POST request to the `/register` path. Passing the json body of the form.

```json
{
  "endpoint": "test",
  "payload": {
    "name: first_name": "anton",
    "age: digits_n,max=2": 29,
    "nothing:": null,
    "true": true,
    "false": false,
    "list:word,max=3": [
      "first",
      "second"
    ],
    "list2": [
      {
        "street:street": "Street 42",
        "city:city": "Stockholm"
      },
      {
        "street": "Street 42",
        "city": "Stockholm"
      }
    ],
    "address": {
      "street:street": "Street 42",
      "city:city": "Stockholm"
    },
    "country": {
      "name:country": "Sweden"
    }
  }
}
```

See the annotation tags on the payload. Example if I want to generate full name for a field name I will just add `"name:full_name"`.

Once your POST request is submitted you are good to ask for the response with fake values. Just make a GET request to the endpoint you registered.

So every GET call to `/api/test` will return the api response with fake data.

# Routes 
Apidemic server has only three http routes

### /
This is the home path. It only renders information about the apidemic server.

### /register
This is where you register endpoints. You POST the annotated sample JSON here. The request body should be a json object of signature.

```json
{
	"endpoint":"my_endpoint",
	"payload": { ANNOTATED__SAMPLE_JSON_GOES_HERE },
}
```

#### /api/{REGISTERED_ENDPOINT_GOES_HERE}
Every GET request on this route will render a fake JSON object for the sample registered in this endpoint.

#### Other HTTP Methods
In case you need to mimic endpoints which respond to requests other than GET then make sure to add an `http_method` key with the required method name into your API description.

```json
{
  "endpoint": "test",
  "http_method": "POST",
  "payload": {
    "name: first_name": "anton"
  }
}
```

Currently supported HTTP methods are: `OPTIONS`, `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, default is `GET`. Please open an issue if you think there should be others added.

#### Emulate unexpected responses
Sometimes you need to ensure that your application handles API errors correctly in which case you can add a `response_code_probabilities` field with a map of response codes to probabilities.
```json
{
  "endpoint": "test",
  "response_code_probabilities": {
    "404": 10,
    "503": 5,
    "418": 1
  },
  "payload": {
    "name: first_name": "anton"
  }
}
```

With the above configuration there's a 84% chance to get a `200 OK` response.
The server will respond with `404 Not Found` about 1 out of 10 times and with `503 Service Unavailable` 1 out of 20 times.
There's also a 1% chance for the server to claim to be a [Teapot](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324).

**Note**: JSON keys must be strings, providing your response codes as integers will not work!

### Registering endpoints automatically
The service will scan the `./endpoints/` directory relative to the currenct working directory on startup. You can change the directory to be scanned by adding a flag `--endpoint-dir=ENDPOINT_DIR`.

# Tags
Apidemic uses tags to annotate what kind of fake data to generate and also control different requrements of fake data.

You add tags to object keys. For instance let's say you have a JSON object `{ "user_name": "gernest"}`. If you want to have a fake username then you can annotate the key by adding user_name tag like this `{ "user_name:user_name": "gernest"}`.

So JSON keys can be annotated by adding the `:` symbol then followed by comma separated list of tags. The first entry after `:` is for the tag type, the following entries are in the form `key=value` which will be the extra information to fine-tune your fake data. Please see the example above to see how tags are used.

Apidemic comes shipped with a large number of tags, meaning it is capable to generate a wide range of fake information.

These are currently available tags to generate different fake data:

# Benchmark
This Benchmark uses [boom](https://github.com/rakyll/boom). After registering the sample json above run the following command (Note this is just to check things out, my machine is very slow)

```bash
 boom -n 1000 -c 100 http://localhost:3000/api/test
```

The result
```bash
